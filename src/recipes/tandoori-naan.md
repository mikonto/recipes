    startNumber: 1
    steps:
      - "Activate yeast: Add yeast (5ml), sugar (5ml) and salt (1.25ml) in a bowl. Add lukewarm water (60ml) and mix all ingredients together. Rest aside for 5 minutes until foamy."
      - "Make dough: In a separate bowl, add flour (190g), yogurt (60ml) and oil (15ml). Add the yeast mixture and mix all ingredients together."
      - "Knead into a smooth dough for about 5-7 minutes. Grease the dough top with oil and rest for 1 hour under a damp towel."

    steps:
      - "After resting, knead dough briefly and divide into 4-6 equal portions."
      - "Roll out each portion into an oval shape, approximately 5-7mm thick."
      - "Heat a pan on medium heat until hot."
      - "Apply a thin layer of water all over one side of the naan."
      - "Place the water-side down on the hot pan - it should stick immediately."
      - "Once bubbles form on top of the naan (about 1-2 minutes), carefully flip the entire pan upside down over the stove flame."
      - "Cook until charred spots appear on the naan (about 1-2 minutes)."
      - "Remove from heat, carefully peel the naan off the pan, brush with butter and serve hot."
notes: "The water application is crucial for the naan to stick to the pan during the flipping technique. If you don't have a gas stove for the flipping method, you can cook both sides in the pan or use a grill/oven broiler for the charred effect. Keep cooked naan wrapped in a kitchen towel to maintain warmth and softness. The dough can be prepared ahead and refrigerated overnight after the first rise."
