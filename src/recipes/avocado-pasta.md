ingredients:
  - 1 garlic clove
  - ½ red chili pepper (seeds removed)
  - 1 lime
  - 2 ripe avocados
  - Salt to taste
  - Black pepper to taste
  - 50 ml olive oil
  - 1 handful fresh basil
  - 1 handful fresh parsley (or coriander as alternative)
  - 30g (100 ml) grated Pecorino Romano cheese
  - 30g (100 ml) grated Parmesan cheese
  - 400-500g spaghetti
instructions:
  - "Prepare the sauce directly in your serving bowl to avoid extra washing up. Finely chop the garlic (1 clove) and chili (½ pepper) and place them in the bowl."
  - "Squeeze the lime juice (1 lime) into the bowl with the garlic and chili."
  - "Prepare the avocados (2 avocados): Cut them in half, remove the stones, and dice the flesh while still in the skin. Scoop out the diced avocado with a spoon into the serving bowl."
  - "Add seasonings and herbs: Finely chop the basil and parsley (1 handful each), grate both cheeses (30g each), then add these to the bowl along with salt, black pepper, and olive oil (50 ml)."
  - "Mix and taste: Stir everything together with a spoon and taste. The sauce must have enough salt - if not, the final result will be bland."
  - "Cook the pasta: Boil the spaghetti (400-500g) in well-salted water (it should taste like seawater) until al dente - about 80% of the cooking time stated on the package. Reserve about 100 ml of the pasta cooking water before draining."
  - "Combine: Drain the pasta and add it to the serving bowl with the avocado sauce. Add a splash of the reserved pasta cooking water (100 ml) to help bind everything together. Toss the spaghetti with the sauce until well coated."
notes: "Make sure your avocados are perfectly ripe - if they're not, save this recipe for another day as it won't work properly with unripe avocados. All ingredients should be at room temperature before mixing to prevent the cold ingredients from cooling down the warm pasta."
