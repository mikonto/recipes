      - "Cook vegetables: In same pan, add yellow onions (100g), oil (1-2 tbsp), and butter (15g). Cook onions until soft and lightly golden (3-4 minutes). Add tomatoes (500g) and cashews (50g). Cook together for 10-12 minutes until tomatoes break down and become jammy."
      - "Add liquids and spices: Add water (125ml), garlic paste (1 tbsp), salt, white wine vinegar (1.5 tbsp), sugar (2 tbsp - taste later), garam masala (1/2 tsp if using), sweet paprika powder (1-2 tbsp), and red chili powder (1/4-1/2 tsp).

    steps:
      - "Add remaining butter (60g), cooking cream (3 tbsp), and cooked chicken. Simmer 5-7 minutes. Taste and adjust sugar/salt."
      - "Garnish with cream and serve with basmati rice."
notes: "The sugar balances the acidity of the tomatoes - start with 2 tbsp and adjust to taste. The straining step ensures a silky smooth restaurant-style gravy."
