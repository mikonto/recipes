ingredients:
  - 300g bread flour (or plain flour)
  - 5g instant yeast (about 3/4 packet)
  - 2g baking powder (1/2 teaspoon)
  - 6g salt (1 teaspoon)
  - 25g sugar
  - 150ml AMA cooking cream (15% fat), cold
  - 2 large eggs, room temperature
  - 75ml whole milk (3.5% fat)
  - 45g butter, melted and cooled
  - 1 tablespoon neutral oil (15ml)
  - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)
instructions:
  - "Prepare the cream: Place 150ml cold AMA cream in a chilled bowl. Whip with electric whisk until soft peaks form (leaves a trail when lifted). Set aside in refrigerator."
  - "Mix dry ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together 300g flour, 5g yeast, 2g baking powder, 6g salt, and 25g sugar until well combined."
  - "Prepare wet ingredients: In another bowl, whisk 2 eggs vigorously for 2 minutes until frothy. Add 75ml warm milk (30-35°C), 45g cooled melted butter, 15ml oil, and vanilla if using. Whisk until well combined."
  - "Combine: Pour the egg mixture into the dry ingredients. Mix with a wooden spoon just until it forms a shaggy, sticky dough."
  - "Fold in cream: Gently fold the whipped cream into the dough using wet hands or spatula. Use 10-15 folding motions - some cream streaks are fine."
  - "Gentle knead: With buttered hands, gently knead the dough in the bowl for 3-5 minutes. The dough will be soft and sticky - this is normal. This step develops gluten for better structure."
  - "First shaping: Line your porcelain dish with buttered baking paper. Transfer dough to dish, spreading gently with wet hands. Dough should fill about 1/3 of dish height."
  - "Rise: Cover loosely with oiled plastic wrap. Let rise for 60-75 minutes until increased by 50-70% and looks puffy."
  - "Bake: Preheat oven to 180°C. Remove plastic wrap gently. Bake for 23-28 minutes until golden brown and springs back when touched. Internal temperature should reach 88-90°C."
  - "Finish: Remove from oven, immediately brush top with melted butter. Cool in dish for 5 minutes, then lift out using paper. Cool on wire rack for 15 minutes before slicing."
notes: "Key features for tender texture: Added oil for flexibility, reduced baking powder, gentle kneading step, shorter baking time, and butter brush at the end. The dough will be soft and sticky - this is normal and creates the fluffy texture."
