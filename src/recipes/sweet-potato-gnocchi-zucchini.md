instructionSections:
  - name: "Prepare the Chicken Meatballs"
    startNumber: 1
    steps:
      - "Preheat oven to 200°C (180°C fan). Line a baking tray with parchment paper and lightly oil."
      - "In a large bowl, combine ground chicken (500g), breadcrumbs (50g), egg, minced garlic (2 cloves), parsley (3 tbsp), Parmesan (30g), salt (1 tsp), and pepper (½ tsp). Mix gently with your hands until just combined (don't overmix - chicken can become tough)."
      - "Form into 20-24 small meatballs, about 3cm diameter each. Place on prepared baking tray, spacing 2cm apart. Brush tops lightly with olive oil for better browning."
      - "Bake for 15-18 minutes, turning once at 8 minutes, until golden brown and cooked through (internal temperature 74°C). Keep warm."

  **Chef's Tips:**
  - Chicken meatballs are more delicate than pork - handle gently and don't overmix
  - Baking is perfect for chicken meatballs as it keeps them moist
  - The slightly shorter cooking time (15-18 minutes vs 18-20) prevents them from drying out
  - Fresh herbs like basil or thyme would also work beautifully with chicken

  **Wine Pairing:**
  A crisp white wine like Pinot Grigio or Sauvignon Blanc would complement the lighter chicken and fresh zucchini flavors perfectly.
