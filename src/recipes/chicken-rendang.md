ingredients:
  - 300 g (10.5 oz) chicken breast, cut into chunks
  - 0.5 tablespoon olive oil
  - 1 onion, chopped
  - 400 ml (1.66 cups) light coconut milk
  - 1 lime (juice only)
  - 1 pinch sea salt
  - 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, very finely chopped
  - "**For the Paste:**"
  - 2 garlic cloves
  - 1 stalk lemongrass, bruised and chopped
  - 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, chopped
  - 1 red chilli, chopped
  - 1 teaspoon ground coriander
  - 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
instructions:
  - "Make the paste by pounding together the garlic, lemongrass, ginger, red chilli, ground coriander and ground turmeric in a pestle and mortar. Set aside."
  - "Heat the olive oil in a pan and cook the chicken until browned all over, about 5-7 minutes."
  - "Add the onion and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes."
  - "Add the paste, mix well and cook for a further minute."
  - "Add the lime juice, sea salt and finely chopped ginger and cook for a further two minutes."
  - "Add the coconut milk and bring to the boil."
  - "Reduce the heat and simmer, allowing the liquids to reduce considerably, about 30 minutes."
  - "Serve with rice."
notes: This isn't a curry, so the sauce should be reduced as much as possible when cooking. If this is too spicy, add some palm sugar or a tablespoon of plain yogurt. Add any vegetables you like.
