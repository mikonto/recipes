ingredients:
  - 125g plain flour
  - 1 teaspoon baking powder
  - ¼ teaspoon salt
  - 115g unsalted butter, room temperature
  - 135g white sugar, plus 1 tablespoon for sprinkling
  - 2 large eggs
  - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
  - 3 tablespoons Licor 43
  - 2 baking apples (about 450-500g after peeling and coring), cut into 1cm cubes
  - Icing sugar for dusting (optional)
instructions:
  - "Preheat the oven to 175°C and position a rack in the middle. Grease a 23cm springform tin or regular cake tin with butter or non-stick spray. If using a regular cake tin, line the bottom with baking paper and grease again."
  - "In a small bowl, whisk together the flour (125g), baking powder (1 teaspoon), and salt (¼ teaspoon)."
  - "Using a kitchen machine with whisk attachment, cream the butter (115g) and white sugar (135g) on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes."
  - "Add the eggs (2), one at a time, beating well and scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition."
  - "Beat in the vanilla extract (1 teaspoon) and Licor 43 (3 tablespoons). The mixture may look slightly curdled at this point - this is normal."
  - "Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture and mix on low speed until just combined. Do not overmix."
  - "Using a rubber spatula, fold in the chopped apples (450-500g, cut into 1cm cubes) by hand."
  - "Scrape the batter into the prepared tin (the batter will be quite fluid - this is normal). Level the top and sprinkle evenly with white sugar (1 tablespoon)."
  - "Bake for about 40 minutes, or until the cake is golden brown on top with a thin crispy layer and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean."
  - "Allow the cake to cool on a rack in the tin. Once cooled slightly, run a knife around the edges. If using a springform tin, remove the sides. If using a regular tin, carefully invert the cake onto the rack, remove the baking paper, then flip right-side-up onto a serving plate."
  - "Dust with icing sugar using a fine sieve if desired. Serve warm or at room temperature."

  **Serving Suggestions:**
  Delicious on its own or served with Greek yogurt (plain or sweetened with a bit of icing sugar and vanilla), vanilla ice cream, or whipped cream.

  **Tips:**
  - Use baking apples that hold their shape when cooked, such as Granny Smith, Honey Crisp, Pink Lady, Braeburn, or Jonagold
  - The fluid batter consistency is correct - it creates the tender, custardy texture
  - A thin crispy top and cracks on the surface are perfect signs of a well-baked cake
  - The cake keeps well at room temperature for up to 2 days
  - Can be frozen for up to 3 months - wrap tightly in foil once completely cooled
