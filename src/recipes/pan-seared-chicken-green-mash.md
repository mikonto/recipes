  **Chef's Tips:**
  - Make sure to drain the vegetables very well for the mash - excess water will make it watery
  - Don't skip the pan sauce - it ties the whole dish together
  - Let the chicken rest for 2-3 minutes after cooking for juicier results
  - The dish should have beautiful color contrast: golden chicken and carrots, vibrant green mash
  - Pairs wonderfully with a Chilean Chardonnay
