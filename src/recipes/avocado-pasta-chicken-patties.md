    startNumber: 9
    steps:
      - "Cook spaghetti (400g) al dente (about 80% of package time) in well-salted water. Reserve about 100ml pasta water before draining."
      - "Add splash of pasta water to sauce, toss spaghetti with avocado sauce until well coated."
      - "Slice chicken patties and arrange on top of pasta."
      - "Top with more Parmesan and freshly ground black pepper, serve immediately."
notes: |
  This combines the fresh, creamy avocado pasta sauce with protein-rich chicken patties for a complete meal. The lemon in the chicken patties complements the lime in the avocado sauce beautifully.
  
  **Tips:**
  - Make sure avocados are perfectly ripe for the best sauce
  - The chicken patties can be made ahead and reheated
  - For a lighter version, make just the avocado pasta without the chicken
  - Note: The original Finnish recipe doesn't specify exact quantities for most sauce ingredients - adjust to taste
