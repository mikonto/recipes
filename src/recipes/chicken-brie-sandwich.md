    startNumber: 11
    steps:
      - "Slice focaccia horizontally."
      - "Bottom half: Spread with garlic sauce (hot kebab sauce)."
      - "Layer in order: Warm chicken with melted brie, fresh basil leaves, tomato slices (lightly salted), thin cucumber slices, sweet pepper strips, avocado slices."
      - "Top half: Spread with Dijon mayonnaise and place on sandwich."
      - "Serve immediately while the chicken is warm and the brie is perfectly soft."
notes: "The leftover focaccias can be saved for tomorrow or frozen. The focaccia dough should be wet and sticky - this is what creates the perfect texture. Make sure to dimple the dough deeply before baking for the characteristic focaccia texture."
