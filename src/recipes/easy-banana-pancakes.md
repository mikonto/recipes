ingredients:
  - 125g plain flour
  - 1 large ripe banana (mashed)
  - 1 egg
  - 150-200ml water OR milk (adjust for consistency)
  - 1 tablespoon vanilla sugar or regular sugar

  - Honey for serving
instructions:
  - "Mash the banana really well with a fork."
  - "Beat in the egg and sugar until combined."
  - "Add flour (125g) and mix."
  - "Add water or milk gradually until you get a thick but pourable batter (like yogurt consistency)."
  - "Heat a pan over medium heat with butter or oil."
  - "Pour small amounts - these are best as smaller pancakes."
  - "Cook 2-3 minutes until bubbles form, flip, cook 1-2 minutes more."
  - "Drizzle honey on top when serving!"
notes: |
  The banana adds natural sweetness and makes these pancakes tender and flavorful. If using milk instead of water, they'll be slightly richer and fluffier.

  **Tip:**
  The riper the banana, the sweeter and better the pancakes will be. These tend to brown faster than regular pancakes because of the banana's natural sugars, so keep the heat at medium.
