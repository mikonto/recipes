instructionSections:
  - name: "Make the Kubdari"
    startNumber: 1
    steps:
      - "In a large bowl, combine flour (250g), salt (1/2 tsp), sugar (1/2 tsp), and yeast (1/2 tsp). Mix well."
      - "Add melted butter (25g), warm water (150ml), and sunflower oil (1 1/2 tbsp) to the dry ingredients. Mix and knead for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Cover and let rise for 1 hour until doubled in size."
      - "Meanwhile, prepare the filling by combining minced beef (350g), minced garlic (1 1/2-2 cloves), chopped onion (1 head), salt (to taste), ground cumin (1/2 tsp), hot pepper (1/4 tsp), and dried garlic powder (1/2 tsp). Mix thoroughly with your hands until well combined."
      - "Divide the risen dough into 2 equal portions. Roll each portion into a circle about 20cm in diameter."
      - "Place half the meat filling in the center of each dough circle. Gather the edges of the dough towards the center and pinch tightly to seal, creating a pouch."
      - "Gently flatten each sealed pouch with your palm, then carefully roll out to about 15cm diameter, being careful not to tear the dough."
      - "Heat a dry frying pan over medium heat. Cook each kubdari for 4-5 minutes per side until golden brown and the meat is cooked through."
      - "Brush with butter while still hot and serve immediately."

    steps:
      - "Cut tomatoes (3-4) into chunky pieces, slice or chop cucumbers (2-3), and thinly slice red onion (1 small). Place all vegetables in a serving bowl."
      - "In a mortar and pestle or food processor, crush walnuts (50-70g) with garlic (1-2 cloves), salt (to taste), and vinegar or lemon juice (1-2 tbsp). Gradually add oil (2-3 tbsp) while crushing until you have a coarse paste."
      - "Pour the walnut dressing over the vegetables and toss until everything is lightly coated."
      - "Roughly chop the fresh herbs and sprinkle over the top. Season with black pepper and additional salt if needed."
      - "If using, add a pinch of chilli flakes or ground coriander for extra flavor."
notes: |
  The kubdari dough can be made ahead and refrigerated overnight. Bring to room temperature before using.
  Traditionally, kubdari uses a mixture of beef and pork, but this recipe uses only beef. You can substitute with lamb or use a combination of meats.
  The walnut dressing for the salad can be made smoother or chunkier according to preference.
  Toast the walnuts lightly in a dry pan before crushing for a deeper, nuttier flavor in the salad.
  Both dishes are best served immediately while the kubdari is still warm.
